# Some Bytes About Me:
I am a health economist who is focused on Health Technology Assessment (HTA). I enjoy applying my knowledge to creating integrated evidence synthesis and health economic decision-models, using languages such as [BUGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBUGS)/[JAGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_another_Gibbs_sampler) and [STAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(software)) coupled with [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).

For some added personal bytes, I encourage the regular use of R within the health economics field. There is an extensive health economics R community, which has risen over the past several years. If any reader is interested, [BCEA](https://github.com/giabaio/BCEA) and [DARTH](https://github.com/DARTH-git) are great packages which are specifically for health economic decision-modelling! Also, [R-HTA](https://r-hta.org/) and the [DARTH](https://darthworkgroup.com/) group are organisations which advocate the use of R for health economics too! My own work includes developing a framework to help analysts choose sensitivity analysis methods within Middle-Income Countries (MICs). A link to the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jSoboil/Dissertation). In short, although the framework encourages simplicity, it also advocates using R for advanced decision-modelling problems, such as incorporating an evidence synthesis or risk aversion preference into a decision-model.
