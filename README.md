# What do I do?
I am a health economist with a great interest in decision-modelling and uncertainty.

I have developed a framework for choosing sensitivity analysis methods within Middle-Income Countries (MICs). A link to the repository for this work can be found (https://github.com/jSoboil/Dissertation)[here].
