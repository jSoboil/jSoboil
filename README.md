# Some Bytes About Me:
I am a health economist who is particularly fond of decision-making and uncertainty. My main port-of-call when I code is the R language. As a result of my interest in health economic decision-modelling methodologies, I was given the opportunity to develop a framework for choosing sensitivity analysis methods within Middle-Income Countries (MICs).
