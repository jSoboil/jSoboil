# What do I do?
I am a health economist who is particularly fond of decision-making and uncertainty. My main port-of-call for coding is the R language. As a result of my interest in health economic decision-modelling methodologies, I was given the opportunity to develop a framework for choosing sensitivity analysis methods within Middle-Income Countries (MICs). A link to the repository for this work can be found (https://github.com/jSoboil/Dissertation)[here]. (This introduction note is a work in progress)
