# Some Bytes About Me:
I am a health economist who is especially fond of the 'decision-making' and Health Technology Assessment (HTA). Naturally, this means that I gravitate towards Bayesian methods. I also am a keen supporter of using R more extensively within the health economics field. If any reader is interested, [BCEA](https://github.com/giabaio/BCEA) and [DARTH](https://github.com/DARTH-git) are great packages which are specifically developed for health economic decision-modelling! Also, [R-HTA](https://r-hta.org/) and [DARTH group](https://darthworkgroup.com/) are organisations which advocate the use of R for the health economics field too! My own work so far includes developing a framework to help analysts choose sensitivity analysis methods within Middle-Income Countries (MICs). A link to the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jSoboil/Dissertation). In short, althogh the framework encourages simplicity, it intends to encourage the use of R for advanced decision-modelling, primarily due the languages efficiency compared with more standard tools used in health economics such Excel.
