I am a health economist who is especially fond of decision-making and uncertainty. I therefore have a keen focus on decision-modelling tools. My main port-of-call when I code is R. I am also keen to see the use of R more extensively within the health economics field, due to its efficiency as well as the extensive libraries which have been developed for health economic decision-modelling. [BCEA](https://github.com/giabaio/BCEA) and [DARTH](https://github.com/DARTH-git) are a great example! Some of my work so far has entailed developing a framework for choosing sensitivity analysis methods within Middle-Income Countries (MICs).
