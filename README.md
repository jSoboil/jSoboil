# Some Bytes About Me:
Hi! I practice health economics, with a focus on Health Technology Assessment (HTA). Because I enjoy problem solving, I have developed a special love for evidence synthesis and advanced health economic decision-modelling, using languages such as [BUGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBUGS)/[JAGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_another_Gibbs_sampler) and [STAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(software)) coupled with [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).

For some added personal bytes, I also encourage the use of R for HTA. An extensive health economics R community has risen over the past several years. If any reader is interested, [BCEA](https://github.com/giabaio/BCEA) and [DARTH](https://github.com/DARTH-git) are great R packages which have been specifically  created for health economic decision-modelling! Also, [R-HTA](https://r-hta.org/) and [DARTH](https://darthworkgroup.com/) are organisations which promote R and provide extensive tutorials on how to use the language for HTA! My own work includes developing a framework intended to help analysts choose appropriate sensitivity analysis methods within Middle-Income Countries (MICs). A link to the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jSoboil/Dissertation). In short, although the framework encourages simplicity, it also advocates for the popularisation of more advanced modelling techniques, as MICs are set to grapple with the burden NCDs more and more, and the use of R to make these models practically efficient.
